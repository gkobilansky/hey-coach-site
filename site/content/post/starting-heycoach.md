  As I college wrestling coach, I've grown to realize that a successful program
  depends on the relationships a coach cultivates with his athletes. So I
  started building a tool to help myself, my coworkers and other coaches build
  those relationships.

To that end, I will soon be launching a beta of the heycoach app, my first version of a Athlete Relationship Management tool. My goals with heycoach is to help you build better relationships with your athletes, from recruits to alumni.

For now, I've limited heycoach to helping you manage the recruiting process. In tech, they call it an MVP --- a Minimum Viable Product. Why start so simple? Well for two reasons:

1. I want to gauge interest as early as possible. If you think a tool that helps you keep track of and build better relationships with your athletes would be helpful, please let me know. You can shoot me a note to <mailto:gene@heycoa.ch> or signup for the newsletter at the bottom of this website.
2. Focusing on a very specific process will help me deliver a better product and react faster to your feedback and needs in this area.

That doesn't mean we'll stay limited to recruiting process though. From recruit, to current athlete, to alumnus - it's the same person. Heycoach will offer a better way to keep track of your athlete's contact info. We will make it simple to connect and improve your relationship. Heycoach will gets out of your way so you can:

* Bring in better recruits
* Build a tight-knit team
* Improve alumni support

Most importantly, I want to hear from YOU sooner than later. Leave a comment below if you think this could be helpful for your team (or if it's the worst idea you've ever hear of).
